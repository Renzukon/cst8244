# Lab02 Part A
## Status 
The program runs as expected, only 1 process that is repeated on the console. Once you enter the kill command, the program will exit
and display the kill and exit message.
There's no known issues. Program will execute until either the kill command is given or the program is stopped. 
## Known Issues
No known issues at the current moment, as the lab only expects you to kill the PID that's displayed on your browser.
## Expected Grade
5/5, as the lab was straight forward with no other type of function behind it
